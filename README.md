# KJELLRC-FYS-STK-4155-Project-2
 Project 2

 NB: I hade to remove and recreate the pbublic repository on GitHub. Not sure why, but the reference now is 2.1

The program is modularized, based on separate tasks, and I have modularized in such a way that the program itself, can run one, several or all modules, in one go for analyses. A separate test environment is, hence, not needed.

The reader can at any time reproduce any test-results or plots, by activating the selected part in the MainModule() in the python fil. The project will only consist of one python fil.

All plots are located in the ./Plots folder and they are named, based on function, parameters and methods. The naming convention is also indicating the size of the sample data, to ease the setup, and re-run the tests.
